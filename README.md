## Blocklet Naming

All blocklets under github.com/blocklet organization follow those naming rules:

- DEMO

Any blocklet name with `DEMO` means this blocklet is built for simple demo purpose, usually the project itself is just the minimal barebone of the scaffold code. `Demo` blocklets have no useful features, only for demo.   

- Example 

Any blocklet name with `Example` means this blocklet is built as an example to showcase the capability of ABT Node and Blocklet framework. The `Example` blocklets usually have useful features than those `Demo` blocklets, but may not stand for production quality. 

- Starter

Any blocklet name with `Starter` means this blocklet is a starter template or a boilerplate template for developers to quickly get started. The starter blocklets may include popular frameworks, tools, library code etc inside and ready to run but usually does not contain any specific features. 

- Deployer

Any blocklet name with `Deployer` means this blocklet is actually wrapped another project which makes it easy to deploy with ABT Node just like a native blocklet. e.g. we make Discourse, Wordpress just like a blocklet through the deployers.
